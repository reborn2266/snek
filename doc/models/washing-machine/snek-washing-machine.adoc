== The Washing Machine

This lesson contains instructions for building and programming a
“Washing Machine”, a simulated household appliance.

== Building The Washing Machine

Follow the next few pages to complete the construction of your washing
machine.  For the wheels, you can use any that will fit on the axles and
not rub on the rest of the model.

Important features:

 * One motor driving the drum
 * Two touch sensors, one to detect when the door is close
   and another to start the machine
 * Two lights to help tell what the machine is doing

=== Sensing Touch

You might want to review the *Switches* section from the Snekboard
lesson because we're going to need to use the `pulldown` function
here.

=== Waiting For A Switch Press

Our washing machine shouldn't start the cycle until the door is
closed. To wait for that, we'll need to wait for our door switch to be
_on_. If we use the `pulldown` function, when the switch is pressed,
the value on the port will be 1 (or True). To wait for that to happen,
we'll use a `while` loop, testing the door switch (A1) over and over
again, but doing nothing in the meantime:

[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	pulldown(A1)
	while not read(A1):
		pass
----


=== Simulating the Wash Cycle

For this, we want the drum to slosh back and forth several
times. Probably not as long as a real washing machine; that can take
half an hour or more. We don't need it to go as fast as
possible, so we'll use a lower speed setting. Here's how to make it
slosh back and forth once:

[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	> *talkto(M1)*
	> *setpower(0.5)*
	> *setleft()*
	> *onfor(0.5)*
	> *setright()*
	> *onfor(0.5)*
----

This makes it go one direction for a short amount of time, and then
switch around and go the other way.

To make it do this several times, we could just copy that code as many
times as we want it to repeat. Or, we could ask the robot to repeat
this a few times with a `for` loop.

==== The For Loop

The `for` loop asks snek to count, and then do something each
time. It will count using numbers by using the `range` function. That
tells snek how far to count. Snek starts counting at 0 and stops
counting just before it reaches the value given to `range`. If you
give range the value 10, then Snek will count 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8 and finally 9. This is ten different numbers, so range(10) means to
count ten times starting at 0.

[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	> *for i in range(10):*
	+	*print(i)*
	+
	0
	1
	2
	3
	4
	5
	6
	7
	8
	9
	>
----

==== Washing Many Times

We can now use a `for` loop to slosh back and forth as many times as
we like, without needing to copy the slosh bits that many times.

[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	def wash():
		talkto(M1)
		setpower(0.5)
		for i in range(10):
			setleft()
			onfor(0.5)
			setright()
			onfor(0.5)

=== Wiring The Washing Machine

Here's one way to wire up the washing machine. If you wire it up
differently, you'll need to adjust for that when programming the
robot.

 1. Connect the motor driving the drum to M1.

 2. Connect the door switch A1 and the switch on top to A8. Make sure
    you insert the connectors the right way, with the black wire
    towards the center of the snekboard and the yellow or white wire
    towards the edge.

 3. Connect the lights to M2 and M3.
